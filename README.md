# mgh80 - "The Arduino of the 80s"

![picture of v1.0](https://github.com/Kris-Sekula/mgh80/blob/main/MGH80_v1.0_front.jpg)

This 5 chip Z80 single-board "computer", is a very simple Z80 based "controller" with 8255 for I/O plus a "Z50Bus" expansion connector. I created it to kick-start my Z80 experiments - breadboarding is fun, but sometimes you want the basics to "just work" so you don't have to troubleshoot loose wires :) 

Features an option to use a local crystal-based oscillator or oscillator module. There is an onboard selector to choose between 27c256 EPROM and 28C256 EEPROM.

Onboard address decoder:
* ROM at 0000h - 7FFFh
* RAM at 8000h - FFFFh
* IO at 00h (IOPortA)
* IO at 01h (IOPortB)
* IO at 02h (IOPortC)
* IO at 03h (Control)

A few solder jumpers allow disconnectingÂ various onboard options (if you for example want to provide an external address decoder)... In the basic configuration you should link (with a solder blob) the following:
* JP1 - enable internal CLK source
* JP2 - enable internal ROM address decoder
* JP3 - enable internal RAM address decoder
* JP4 - enable internal IO(8255) address decoder

Simple "blinky" program source (.asm) included and a compiled hex files (.hex) for 27C256 EPROM (or my EPROM emulator). It will toggle all lines of port B a few times a second.
